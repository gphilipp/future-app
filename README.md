# Clojurescript with React-native advanced compilation


I'm trying to use :advanced mode to compile more efficient javascript.

You just have to type: 
 
`lein clean && lein prod-build && react-native run-ios --configuration Release`


**This branch is the stock application generated with `re-natal init`.**

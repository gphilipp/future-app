# Clojurescript with React-native advanced compilation


I'm trying to use :advanced mode to compile more efficient javascript.

You just have to type: 
 
`lein clean && lein prod-build && react-native run-ios --configuration Release`


This branch uses https://github.com/artemyarulin/react-native-externs.
